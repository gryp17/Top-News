And the only anger Williams displayed was directed at her opponent, Victoria Azarenka, while they traded gestures and words over the chair umpire's decision to replay a key point.<p>By the end, when she was aggressively grabbing the final six games and 10 of the final 12, all that really mattered was that the No. 1-ranked Williams was not going to let this one get away. Williams erased deficit after deficit and beat former No. 1 Azarenka 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 Saturday in a third-round French Open match filled with momentum swings and one GIF-ready contentious exchange.<p>\"I was just really down and out in that match, and I just feel like, you know, I just really zeroed in,\" Williams said. \"I really focused and I really wanted to win that.\"<p>Williams is 28-1 in 2015, 9-0 in three-setters. The American improved to 50-11 at Roland Garros, making her the first woman since 1968, when Grand Slam tournaments admitted professionals, to have that many wins at each major.<p>She's never been as comfortable or confident on the French Open's dusty red clay as with grass or hard courts underfoot, exiting in the second round last year and the first in 2012. She's been past the quarterfinals once in the past 12 years - in 2013, when she won her second French Open title.</div><div><p>Compare that to the 33-year-old's trophies elsewhere: six apiece from the Australian Open and U.S. Open, five from Wimbledon.<p>Azarenka owns a pair of Australian Open trophies. She also was twice a U.S. Open finalist, but lost each time to Williams, who has won 16 of their 19 matchups. They tend to be close as can be: This month on clay in Madrid, Williams won after Azarenka double-faulted three times while serving for the match.<p>So maybe that collapse and Saturday's, when Azarenka led by a set and 4-2 in the second, are an indication that Williams holds an edge in more than shotmaking. She produced nearly twice as many winners as Azarenka, 41 to 21.<p>\"She really stepped it up,\" the 27th-seeded Azarenka said. \"Nobody is probably harder … for me to play against.\"<p>On the last point of the second set, Azarenka hit a shot that landed near the baseline. Williams netted a response at about the same time an \"out\" call came. Chair umpire Kader Nouni decided the point should be replayed, which Azarenka disputed. She and Williams wound up looking at each other, and Azarenka waved her hand, as if to say, \"Eh, never mind.\" Williams then appeared to tell Azarenka not to wag her hand.<p>Azarenka, who still was steamed about Nouni's ruling after the match, lost the replayed point, giving Williams the set, and was warned for a visible obscenity.<p>Azarenka headed to a bathroom break. When she returned, she took a 2-0 lead in the third set.<p>Williams wouldn't drop another game.<p>The two are friends away from the court, and both downplayed whatever testiness there seemed to be between them Saturday.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"No. 1 Williams edges Azarenka in French Open's 3rd round","category":"economy"},"32":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/32.jpeg","summary":"The campaign of Sen.

That's when ratings are won. There will be other OTAs. And, like the man said, it's hard to get everybody there.</div><div><p>Here's the playbook for \"DeSean Jackson Home Team,\" according to Variety: \"Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson is at the top of his game as one of the most talked-about and watched players in the NFL today. That means eyes are always on him— waiting for him to score touchdowns and waiting for him to drop the ball off the field. Even though he has the money and the fame, DeSean's life is actually run by a core group of women including his 'momager,' Gayle, his sister and assistant A'Dreea, his publicist Denise and his new girlfriend, Kayla. Produced by Rogue Atlas Productions in association with Lionsgate Television, Eli Frankel, Ryan Holcomb, Elise Duran, DeSean Jackson and Byron Jackson serve as executive producers. Jay Fragus and Lawrence Bell serve as co-executive producers.\"<p>I didn't see Scot McCloughlan's or Jay Gruden's name in there anywhere.<br />I'd expect to see Jackson's week of fun show up on his new program, though we don't know for sure. But if so, he has every right to do so. The confusing and frustrating part of this is that these are called \"voluntary\" workouts. The concept of these voluntary workouts puts players in difficult positions publicly, such as in cases like this. Jackson had every right to pursue this opportunity — but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.<p>They may be voluntary, but tell that to the players that did report to Redskins Park this week to take part in the first OTAs under a new general manager, new offensive line coach, new defensive coordinator and new quarterbacks coach. Nearly every Redskin player felt it was important enough to be present and begin the process of \"working together and just putting it in,\" as Jackson described OTAs last year.<p>All likely had other places they could be. For one player — even one as accomplished as Jackson — to decide his commitments were more important than theirs is not good for a franchise trying to install a \"culture change.\"<br />Yes, the dreaded words \"culture change\" reared their laughable head again this week at Redskins Park.<p>Of course, it was Robert Griffin III who uttered the most meaningless words ever spoken in that building when he talked about his relationship with Gruden.<p>\"We look forward to working together to help this team and lead this team in the right direction and create this culture change that we know we need to have,\" Griffin told reporters.<p>Culture change? Not a season seems to go by at Redskins Park where someone doesn't declare a culture change is underway, only for this team to wind up in the same dark place at the end of the season of culture change.<p>Culture change? You mean like when one of your most important players skips the first step in the process when \"Super Bowls and championships are won?\"<p><em>• Thom Loverro is co-host of \"The Sports Fix,\" noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com.</em></div></div>","title":"LOVERRO: DeSean Jackson looking out for 'Home Team' with recent absence","category":"sport"},"118":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/118.jpeg","summary":"The White House said Friday there is \"no plan B\" if key Patriot Act powers expire at midnight Sunday.","image_name":"118.jpeg","date":"2015-05-29","content":"<div><div><p>The White House said Friday there is \"no plan B\" if key Patriot Act powers expire at midnight Sunday.<p>Administration officials pressed Senate leaders — currently on a weeklong Memorial Day recess — to return to Washington and immediately pass legislation that would extend most government surveillance tools but also would take steps to protect Americans' privacy.<p>\"There is no plan B.

France has not announced any arrests and this week said it was still investigating.<p>In statements marked \"strictly confidential\" and first reported by the AP this week, the U.N. deputy high commissioner for human rights in March said she had \"failed to follow up\" on the allegations gathered by her own office, even as French authorities pressed U.N. officials for several months for more information.<p>The two new letters indicate a crisis in an office that says it \"represents the world's commitment to universal ideals of human dignity.\"<p>The letter dated May 8 from U.N. human rights field staffers is an angry response to last month's suspension of colleague Anders Kompass for telling French authorities, a decision that the U.N. Dispute Tribunal reversed this month. The U.N. says Kompass breached protocol in sharing the report of children's allegations without redacting the names in it.

The mission included human rights staffers. The French soldiers were supporting the mission under a U.N. mandate.<p>Her letter notes the rumor that a second staffer, a woman, had also given the allegations to the French, and Brown says it wasn't her. A confidential statement by Zeid dated late March, obtained by the AP, mentions \"not one but possibly two sources.\"<p>If the U.N. wants a complete investigation into how the child sexual abuse allegations were handled, it will need Brown's testimony, her letter says.<p>Brown asserts that under Swiss law she is no longer protected against a possible defamation claim for giving testimony in the U.N. internal investigation, now that she no longer works for the United Nations.<p>Her letter says she was terminated May 21. The next day, an investigator with the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services was still asking her to testify, a copy of the email request shows. The investigator says he isn't clear how the immunity issue would affect her.

(AP) - The newly legal hemp industry is entering its second growing season with some big questions for producers experimenting with marijuana's non-intoxicating cousin.<p>The federal government has allowed limited imports of hemp seed - in Colorado's case, this month - for research and development purposes. Companies trying to create a U.S. hemp industry are seeking investors not only for unproven products but for a plant that is still classified under the federal Controlled Substances Act with marijuana and thus cannot be patented.<p>As a result, it's too soon to tell whether hemp will become a boon for farmers or stay in mostly boutique products that use imported hemp.<p>At least 22 states allow hemp cultivation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, though most are limited to experimental testing, not commercial industry. Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture say they're not sure how many states are growing hemp or how much is being produced.<p>Two hemp facilities in northern Colorado underscore the crop's uncertainty.<p>A biomass factory about an hour's drive north of Denver is processing hemp into pulp, sugars and lignin. PureVision Technology CEO Ed Lehrburger is also experimenting with hemp stalks, sensing potential for a broad array of industrial uses but unable to secure enough to see whether it could replace wheat, corn and wood as raw materials for use in things like plastics, fuels and packaging.</div><div><p>\"We don't have enough hemp to process,\" said Lehrburger, who created a subsidiary, PureHemp Technology, but concedes the hemp business is a few years from taking off. He's paying $500 a ton for the scarce commodity, compared to $65 for a ton of corn stalks.<p>But Lehrburger is bullish on hemp's industrial potential. Pointing to a room-sized machine that processes the biomass into pulp, Lehrburger explained that hemp stalks become pulp faster than other raw materials and require less water.<p>Just down the road, a greenhouse contains a more tantalizing prospect. The company CBDRx is growing several hundred hemp plants in order to extract cannabidiol - frequently shortened to CBD - a non-intoxicating part of hemp that some believe has a variety of medical applications, from alleviating pain and inflammation to managing seizures.<p>CBDRx's owners believe hemp's therapeutic potential far exceeds any other commercial use. The company, created in January, plans to expand to 200 or more employees within a year, thanks to a large investment of venture capital.<p>\"We see this as a very huge market, much bigger than the marijuana market,\" said Alejandro Bergad, CBDRx's chief agricultural officer for the company. \"We're poised for national expansion.\"<p>But CBDRx must first to develop a product they can't yet patent and make sure their plants don't contain too much of the plant's more popular chemical, THC, which produces a high.<p>The federal Controlled Substances Act makes no difference between hemp as a plant and marijuana as a drug.<p>Plants containing more than 0.3 percent THC are considered marijuana and must be destroyed by law, though licensed hemp growers aren't subject to criminal prosecution if their plants are too strong. Last year, the first in which Colorado licensed hemp growers, agriculture authorities ordered the destruction of about an acre's worth of plants after spot inspections, out of 1,811 total licensed acres.<p>More growers have signed up this year, with 2,637 acres licensed. Colorado now allows indoor hemp production, too, with 465,000 square feet in production statewide, such as the CBDRx greenhouse.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"Hemp industry enters 2nd year with hazy market potential","category":"economy"},"16":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/16.jpg","summary":"Former Maryland Gov.

Businesses and individuals must buy multiple websites in self-defense against domains like .sucks, which debuts in June. Mr. Obama is adding cost, confusion and cronyism to the Internet, just as Obamacare did for the nation's health care system. Mr. Obama's giving away U.S. control of the Internet is a mistake on par with Jimmy Carter's giving away America's control of the Panama Canal.<p>Thanks to the administration's shift, finding websites will become more complicated. Instead of remembering whether a site ends with .com, .org, .net, .edu, .gov or some other \"top-level domain,\" users will face over 1,000 extensions.<p>Many of these are confusing.<p>Was the ending .fish? Or .fishing? Did you want .florist? Or .flowers? Can't remember whether the ending is .gift, .gifts or .gives? Was it .market, .markets or .marketing? Is the law office at .lawyer or .attorney? Is the broker at .trade or .trading? And then there are .sex, .sexy, .porn and .xxx.</div><div><p>Plenty more domain names are on the way. The floodgates have been opened by the group Mr. Obama put in charge, ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Wall Street Journal tech editor Gordon Crovitz writes, \"President Obama's plan to give up protection of the open Internet is wreaking havoc.\" Mr. Crovitz calls ICANN an \"abusive monopolist,\" an example of more \"bungling\" by this president.<p>Mr. Obama gave ICANN the keys to unlock fabulous wealth by creating unlimited extensions. ICANN charges each applicant $185,000. With over 2,000 applicants so far, that provides guaranteed revenue of over $370 million.<p>Those enormous fees make the new Internet extortion racket seem cheap. The early-bird going rate for each .sucks domain is $2,500 each, for now. Existing trademark holders must act before June 1 lest the names fall into unfriendly hands. Those acting already reportedly include Wal-Mart, Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo.<p>Fortune 500 companies would pay over $1.2 million in registration fees if each purchased only a single domain name in self-defense of its trademark, reputation and good will. But multiply the expense by the number of brand names they utilize. Procter & Gamble has scores of consumer brands. Coca-Cola claims over 500 brands for its beverages. General Motors uses 13 auto brands; Ford Motor Co. uses dozens.<p>An unlimited number of national and local businesses will need to fork over $2,500 per name and per brand to protect themselves from having \".sucks\" fall into hostile hands. The alternative is litigation or a costly process of trying to block those websites.<p>Celebrities must defend not only by purchasing .sucks but also URLs that follow the person's name with .xxx, .porn or anything similar. Taylor Swift and Kevin Spacey are two among the thousands of celebrities who reportedly have done so. And so have many universities and other groups.<p>Is there a legitimate need for this government-created chaos? Even before ICANN opened Pandora's box by adding 1,000 top-level domains, the Internet had over 600 million websites and seemed to be doing pretty well on its own.<p>The company that runs .sucks, Vox Populi, claims it is simply providing a public service for legitimate protests. That sounds suspiciously like what we heard from the Occupy movement as it trashed parks and committed public indecencies. The Internet already has popular sites devoted to lodging complaints, public as well as private, including Ripoffreport.com and Consumerist.com. Their business models now are upended by the opportunism of Vox Populi's .sucks.<p>At a recent congressional hearing, Rep. Darrell E. Issa, California Republican, called the domain .sucks \"legalized extortion.\" Mr. Obama approved ICANN, then ICANN approved the domain, but now is asking the Federal Trade Commission and others to shut it down.

The Washington Times recently caught up with Weidemaier to discuss the Nationals' string of early errors, his defensive philosophy and his baseball career as a whole.<p><strong>You were a scout for a lot of years. How did you get here, to your current job with the Nationals?<br />Answer:</strong> \"You know, my specialty's kind of the infield stuff. So in spring training [in Arizona], Matt and I were always working together, doing the infield on the same field. So we developed a bond. It was not the last year there — the first year, in 2011, we won the division. … I think that was the year Matt said, 'Hey, whatever happens, why don't you stick around. I'm going to manage this fall league team, why don't you help me the first couple weeks?' We had workouts to get ready for the season. So I did, and we got closer. And he started talking about, 'Hey, listen. I'm going to get a managing job one of these days, I hope, and if I do, I want you to come with me as a coach. Not just an advance scout. I want you to be with me in uniform.' And sure enough, things worked out here. Last year, he brought me over here with him. One of the key things, I think, that made us attractive was the last year we were in Arizona, we had the best defense in baseball — fielding percentage, least runs allowed per the opposition. So with my reports coming to him and then him meeting with the guys like we do here —and I handle that here, putting together the schemes and how we're going to play guys positionally — I think we did really well. I think that was a selling point here, because their defense hadn't been very good. Now having said all that, we've had our hands full here.\"<p><strong>Q: With all those errors early in the season, fans were saying, \"Oh, you have to improve the defense.\" I'm curious: Is there really anything you can do to improve that?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> \"We've done a couple things. It all comes back to repetition: More work, more grounders, more focus on what you're doing out there. And the way you do that is to give them more work, right? So, we've got a deal now where — and we've loosened up a little bit, and as it starts to get hot, we'll loosen up a bit more — but we bring all the guys, middle-infielders, out at 3:30 [p.m.]. Nobody around. Don't have to worry about batting practice balls being hit, flying around. You've got a clean surface. We bring the corner guys out at 3:45, and we really just accentuate, give them quality time. Some of them don't even need groundballs during batting practice, because it's a pretty good workout. A few guys keep taking a few just to stay loose. But that's one thing we've done to say, 'Hey, make it a priority.' We're going to give you a chance on a clean infield, without balls flying around, let's just work on it. Pay attention to it. Guys, I think they just put more effort into it. And we've had the same guys out there for a while now, so there's been more continuity.<hr /><p><strong> SEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Bryce Harper, Max Scherzer providing a little edge to the Nationals </strong><hr /><p>\"And I will say, [Yunel] Escobar's been fabulous. I mean, this guy, we brought him in here to play second, then we tell him, 'You're going to go to third.' And he's done it with a smile, and he's worked his [butt] off. His work — he comes out here, he'll get on his knees, I'll hit him balls on the grass. He fields them forehand, backhand. Then he gets up, takes short fungoes. Then he goes deep. Every play: forehand, backhand. Turns double plays, with energy and enthusiasm. For him, it ain't work. He likes doing it. He's having fun. But that, if you understand what I mean, that kind of rubs off, that enthusiasm. And because he's really good at it, guys are like, 'Oh, let's all get into that.' He's had an impact. No question.\"<p><strong>Q: What's your philosophy on shifts? I know you guys have done that a little bit this year, but not much.</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> \"Well, it's interesting that you should ask that, because last year there was a lot of talk about it. I think the public's perception is a little bit inaccurate, OK? Shifting is when you have three infielders on one side, which is a pretty severe deal. We do, against the Yankees, we did more of it because there's more guys according to all the charts we get — which, we have a multitude of information, spray charts, percentages — they have a lot of guys who pull the ball, so we tended to be a little more extreme. We do a lot more of what I call shading. In other words, we'll play a guy strong up the middle. We'll play a guy way off the line, way on one side, but we don't put three infielders on one side, and to me, that's a shift. We don't do that a whole hell of a lot. A lot of what we do, we try to tie into what our pitchers do. A lot of teams, they don't give a [crap] what the guy pitching does. They're going to go off the book, what the hitters do. We really tend to blend it with our pitchers, and there's certain guys that don't want that. They'd rather be more straight-up or more shade, but not a shift. The thing I think a lot of people don't really understand is three infielders on one side, that is a shift. But you're going to see us play a lot of guys, [Ian Desmond], hard up the middle. Our second baseman, play to pull. [Ryan Zimmerman] will be way off into what we call the four-hole in between second and first. So, we do a lot of that, which I think puts guys in the right position.<p>\"But I think people got caught up on the shifting, shifting. Well it's not that we overplay all the time, but we do shade. We do play to percentages a lot. Not three guys on one side. That's the big difference. And when you're talking the outfield, which a lot of people don't think about, we do a lot of that, shading in the outfield. Now you overshift in the outfield, it's pretty dangerous, because there's nobody behind those guys. In the infield, there's somebody behind you. You've got to be a little more neutral in the outfield. But we have meetings before every series, before every new opponent, where we go over every hitter and how we're going to play them. Then I have a sheet that we actually, it's in plastic, but I post it right there, versus right-handed pitching and versus left-handed pitching, where every guy pull, straight up, hard middle, so they can refer to that during a game, if they have any questions.\"</div><div><p><strong>Q: So in terms of shading and shifting, how much of that do you do compared to other teams in the league? </strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> \"Well, it's been proven, we're probably not even in the top 20. I don't know. I've seen stats where we're down there. But I think they're going off of shifts. They don't look at shades. They look at three on one side. Astros are big at it, Tampa's big at it. I just had, one of our guys gave me some stats, I think Tampa and maybe the Yankees do a lot of it, and they've held the batting averages down. The Astros do the most, and actually they've hit higher against their shifts, so you can't get crazy with it. And I think, like the commissioner talking about doing away with it, are you [freaking kidding] me? No. 1, if you've got three guys on this side, the whole other side of the field's open. We're going to hit the ball that way. But we're not that extreme as a lot of teams are. And also I think you have to take into consideration your athletes and what kind of range they have. Do you really need to do that? When we've got a guy like Danny Espinosa who has great range, we don't need to. He could still be on this side of second, hard middle, and still get the ball that's even on the shortstop's side. It's relative to your personnel. And we try to take that into consideration.\"<p><strong>Q: This your second year doing this. You've done just about every job in baseball. Which one was your favorite?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Well, this is the best job. I've never had a bad job in baseball. Early on — and hell, I managed in the Mexican League, I've been to winter ball for 28 years in one capacity or another — coming up, I really had two goals. One of them was to be a field coordinator, which I did, and an advanced scout, which I did. I'm not sure when I started — I've been in advance for a long time, damn near 20 years — I started saying, 'You know what? I can [freaking] coach in the big leagues.' And getting this opportunity, [shoot], I'm 60, it's a dream come true. These are the greatest players in the world, and the best cathedrals, ballparks, in the world. There's no higher league. These are the best players. Whether they play like it every night or not, they're the best players. So, it's the most fun. And the other big thing — I loved advancing because it was the closest thing to being on the field. For the Dodgers for all those years and Arizona, I coordinated major league spring training, but then I would break off to start scouting our opponents, in the advance scouting role. Well, the thing you miss most is 7 o'clock. It's the competition of being in the dugout close to the action, you know what I mean? The competitive juices, which you still get doing that advance job, but you're not right here where the action is. And that's a lot of fun. Gametime is a lot of fun, being a part of that. So, it's the best job I ever had. Bottom line. So, that's about it.<p>\"It's been a good ride. Matt's been great. I didn't play in the big leagues, so I didn't have a bubble gum card that was going to get me a job because of my reputation. I had to have a sponsor, and he was my guy. I couldn't have picked a better one. I think he's a tremendous manager. I think he's going to be even better. I think he's getting better, and he was Manager of the Year last year. His personality, his playing background, his competitiveness, his ability to teach — he's the total package. So, it's really neat to be with a guy like that. And he gives me a lot of authority to do my job, to run things on the defensive side, which there's some guys you work for who micromanage. You're kind of like, 'Uh, am I just here to throw BP and hit fungoes?' But I get to do a lot. I get a lot of input. So, it's good. It's good.\"</div></div>","title":"The Conversation: Mark Weidemaier talks early string of errors, defensive philosophy","category":"sport"},"27":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/27.jpg","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) - Dennis Hastert's career as House speaker both arose and ended amid the sex-related scandals of others.","image_name":"27.jpg","date":"2015-05-30","content":"<div><div><p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Dennis Hastert's career as House speaker both arose and ended amid the sex-related scandals of others.<p>Now, eight years after leaving Congress, Hastert's own legacy is threatened by an indictment charging financial misdeeds - and cryptically referring to \"misconduct\" against an unnamed individual. A person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press Friday that Hastert paid the individual in an apparent effort to conceal decades-old allegations involving sexual misconduct.<p>It's a stunning development for the former pol, who rose from obscurity to become the most powerful Republican in Congress for eight years, even as he mostly shunned the limelight. He faded quickly from view after leaving Congress in 2007.<p>\"The Denny I served with worked hard on behalf of his constituents and the country,\" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. \"I'm shocked and saddened to learn of these reports.\"<p>Hastert was propelled to the speakership in 1998 on the tumultuous December day on which the House impeached President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair. During the raucous debate, the presumptive speaker, Bob Livingston of Louisiana, stunned the political world as he announced he would step down over revelations of his own marital infidelities.<p>Hastert rose from the junior ranks of leadership in large part because he was without controversy, unlike other contenders such as Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the politically toxic driving force behind Clinton's impeachment. Hastert was a behind-the-scenes operative whose political identity came from small-town Illinois, where he was a high school wrestling coach and teacher before serving in the state House and then Congress.</div><div><p>\"They do call me 'the Coach' on the Hill, and I guess one of my roles is to put other people out there in the limelight,\" Hastert said at the time, adding that his role was to \"move an agenda forward and bring people together.\"<p>For eight years, Hastert was a steady hand guiding House Republicans as they held narrow House majorities. Time and time again, he delivered for President George W. Bush, helping drive major legislation cutting taxes and creating a Medicare prescription drug benefit into law.<p>Hastert overcame early perceptions that DeLay, known for his hardball tactics, was the real power in the House. The Illinois lawmaker earned the respect and loyalty of colleagues throughout GOP ranks, playing \"good cop\" to DeLay's \"bad cop.\"<p>\"There's clearly a division within the conference between moderates and the right, and he can bridge that better than anyone,\" former Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., said at the time.<p>Rumpled and low-key, Hastert was anything but the polarizing force of his Republican predecessor, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, or his own Democratic successor, Nancy Pelosi of California.<p>\"He was viewed as so boring and vanilla, we barely even mentioned him in our communications against Republicans,\" recalls Democratic operative Doug Thornell.<p>But in 2006, Hastert became embroiled in an election-season controversy involving his handling of a scandal involving Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., who had been discovered sending inappropriate emails and sexually explicit instant messages to former House pages. Hastert was among the GOP lawmakers who knew of the contacts, and the House Ethics Committee concluded that he and his aides had known about some of the messages and hadn't responded aggressively.<p>The Foley scandal, coming on the heels of indictments of lawmakers such as DeLay and Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham, R-Calif., on other matters, was a tipping point in the election that delivered control of Congress to Democrats. Hastert resigned his seat the following year.<p>Now, Hastert is facing charges that he broke banking laws and lied to the FBI to conceal efforts to deliver a promised $3.5 million in hush money to someone cryptically identified in Justice Department documents as \"Individual A\" to keep Hastert's \"prior misconduct\" against that person a secret.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"Hastert rose to speakership among the scandals of others","category":"politics"},"95":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/95.jpeg","summary":"PHILADELPHIA — A slimmer Tim Tebow threw passes in shorts while a horde of reporters critiqued his mechanics and analyzed his arm motion.","image_name":"95.jpeg","date":"2015-05-28","content":"<div><div><p>PHILADELPHIA — A slimmer Tim Tebow threw passes in shorts while a horde of reporters critiqued his mechanics and analyzed his arm motion.<p>Welcome to Philly, Tim.<p>The 2007 Heisman Trophy winner spoke to a large gathering of media for the first time on Thursday since signing a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles last month.<p>Tebow praised coach Chip Kelly and teammates, explained his new appreciation for football after being out of the NFL for two years and emphasized he is a quarterback.<p>\"I think you just go out and you compete and you try to earn whatever you can,\" Tebow said. \"It's just about competing, trying to get better every day and that's the goal.\"<p>A former first-round pick by the Denver Broncos, Tebow is hoping to earn a roster spot on his fourth team.

The small group of largely unelected sports bureaucrats who decide which bid wins quickly realize their votes are valuable.<p>\"I think there's some true economic motivation, especially when you're a country like the U.S. and England, the other two main bidders besides Russia and Qatar\" for upcoming World Cups, said Victor Matheson, an economist at College of the Holy Cross. \"In those cases, this would have just been a cash cow for these places. The U.S. and England were perfectly set up to host the World Cup at almost no additional cost.\"<p>However, the motivations for other countries are not the same, said Mr. Matheson.<p>\"When you're a Brazil or a Qatar or a Russia, this is much less about the actual event itself than using the event to either advertise yourself or to use the event as an excuse to build all sorts of general infrastructure for the country. The actual World Cup is more of a three-week event, but it's more like a ten-year building process where you use the World Cup as an excuse to build billions of dollars in general infrastructure.\"</div><div><p>Money scandals are nothing new to international sporting events. Mitt Romney famously was called in to rescue the troubled Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 after revelations surfaced of extensive bribes by members of the organizing committee to win the rights to the games. Even in ancient Greece, judges at the original Olympic Games were often accused of taking bribes and entering their own horses in equestrian events.<p>Sports economist and author Andrew Zimbalist, who teaches at Smith College, said the problem runs deeper. It's a system, he told NPR in a recent interview, virtually guaranteed to encourage graft and bribery.<p>\"You have one seller in the case of the Olympics: the [International Olympic Committee]. You have one seller in the case of World Cup: FIFA,\" he noted. \"And you have cities, or countries, from around the world that are bidding against each other, so you have multiple buyers and one seller.\"<p>The result: \"It's a monopoly situation, and the monopolist takes advantage of that.\"<p><strong>Upfront costs vs. long-term payoff</strong><p>Mr. Matheson explained that when the U.S. hosted the event in 1994, it brought around 2.5 million spectators, most of whom were visitors from outside the country. When South Africa staged the 2010 World Cup, the first African nation to host the tournament, at least 200,000 more tourists than usual came to the country during the course of the tournament.<p>But despite the benefits of long-term infrastructure improvements, the upfront cost in hosting a global event like the World Cup or the Olympics vastly outweighs the potential payoff.<p>\"From a pure dollars-and-cents standpoint, it makes absolutely zero sense for a country like Qatar, or even a country like Russia, to host the World Cup,\" said Mr. Matheson. \"They're spending billions of dollars on stadiums when they have no soccer league. It's difficult to see how they're possibly going to make any money back on this.\"<p>This would not be the first major sport-related boondoggle for Moscow. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, whose full cost is incalculable but was widely reported to cost the state around $50 billion, drew criticism on several fronts for its cost and location in a subtropical region close to previously embattled regions of Chechnya and Ossetia.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"FIFA scandal highlights culture of corruption in World Cup, Olympics bidding","category":"sport"},"106":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/106.jpg","summary":"PARIS (AP) - The Latest from the French Open:","image_name":"106.jpg","date":"2015-05-30","content":"<div><div><p>PARIS (AP) - The Latest from the French Open:<p>___<p>10:26 p.m.<p>Forget flowers, try saying it with shorts.<p>Seems to have worked for Victoria Azarenka.

Carter spoke at an international security conference here Saturday at the start of an 11-day Asia trip.<p>McCain, who also was attending the International Institute for Strategic Studies summit, wants to see a gradual removal of the U.S. ban, and said the U.S. should provide additional defensive weapons that could be used in case of a conflict with China. He added that the U.S. should continue its ban on weapons used for crowd control or to commit human rights abuses.<p>The U.S. last October partially lifted its ban on weapons sales to Vietnam to boost the country's ability to defend itself in the South China Sea. Only the sale of lethal maritime security and surveillance capabilities are allowed on a case-by-case basis, including boats and air assets based on an evaluation of Vietnam's needs.

But it also was largely driven by America's national security interests.<p>Since then, tensions in the South China Sea have only escalated, as China has greatly expanded land reclamation projects to build islands on existing reefs and atolls. On Friday, defense officials revealed that China had put two large artillery vehicles on one of the artificial islands, fueling fears in the U.S and across the Asia-Pacific that China will try to use the land building projects for military purposes or to restrict navigation in the South China Sea.<p>China has defended its activities in the South China Sea as legitimate.

Washington approved non-lethal arms sales in 2006, and ties have since deepened further, particularly as the Obama administration has sought to expand U.S. engagement in Asia.<p>Vietnam has been pressing for the lifting on the U.S. ban, and officials there have argued that if the country can't buy weapons from the U.S., it could still buy from other nations.

The new standards call for increases in blending over the next several years, but those increases fall far short of what lawmakers called for in 2007 legislation.<p>Lawmakers and other EPA critics say the latest standards reflect how the RFS, written years before U.S. oil and gas production exploded, must be scrapped or, at the very least, dramatically overhauled.<p>\"EPA's announcement adds to the building evidence of how poorly the agency has managed the renewable fuel standard, and how the mandate is in need of significant reform and oversight. Clearly, the statutory volumes are unachievable,\" Sen. Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. \"Congress wrote the RFS with the assumption that gasoline demand would continue to increase significantly due to concerns about domestic sources of energy. However, the shale boom has led to extensive growth in U.S. oil and gas production.\"<p>The EPA's latest targets are more than a year behind schedule. As a result, the agency released a 2014 standard that reflects \"the actual amount of domestic biofuel use in that year.\" The EPA also released targets for 2015 and 2016.<p>For 2014, the EPA said the total amount of renewable fuel blending was 15.93 billion gallons. It has proposed raising that figure to 16.30 billion gallons in 2015 and 17.40 billion gallons in 2016 — more than 4 billion gallons per year lower than what Congress called for in the 2007 legislation.</div><div><p>\"This proposal marks an important step forward in making sure the Renewable Fuel Standard program delivers on the congressional intent to increase biofuel use, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security,\" said Janet McCabe, the acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. \"We believe these proposed volume requirements will provide a strong incentive for continued investment and growth in biofuels.\"<p>But the EPA also admits that it is out of compliance with the levels set by Congress, largely because current fuel infrastructure and automobiles are unable to use gasoline that includes more than 10 percent ethanol. The inability to get beyond the 10-percent figure commonly is referred to as the \"blend wall\" and represents a serious hurdle for the ethanol industry.<p>\"Due to constraints in the fuel market to accommodate increasing volumes of ethanol, along with limits on the availability of non-ethanol renewable fuels, the volume targets specified by Congress in the Clean Air Act for 2014, 2015 and 2016 cannot be achieved. However, EPA recognizes that the statutory volume targets were intended to be ambitious; Congress set targets that envisioned growth at a pace that far exceeded historical growth rates,\" the EPA said in a fact sheet.<p>Opponents of the RFS say the administration must scrap the standard and acknowledge that more biofuel blending into gasoline supplies is not only unnecessary but economically dangerous.<p>\"EPA is saddled with the impossible task of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole,\" said the RFS Off the Menu coalition, a campaign focused on killing the RFS standard. \"It is time for Congress to recognize the RFS is a failed policy and either repeal it altogether or engage in a wholesale overhaul. Nothing EPA or any other agency can do will alleviate the RFS' undeniable impact on food commodity prices.\"<p>Specifically, the EPA said that in 2014 about 33 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel were blended with gasoline, along with 1.63 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel and 2.68 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.<p>For 2015, the agency is calling for those figures to increase to 106 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 1.7 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 2.9 billion gallons of advanced biofuel. In 2016, the numbers increase further, to 206 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 3.4 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 3.4 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.</div></div>","title":"Biofuels mandate mess: New EPA ethanol standards under fire","category":"world"},"67":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/67.jpeg","summary":"A leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin was hospitalized with kidney failure one day after releasing a documentary on corruption and human rights abuses in the republic of Chechnya.","image_name":"67.jpeg","date":"2015-05-29","content":"<div><div><p>A leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin was hospitalized with kidney failure one day after releasing a documentary on corruption and human rights abuses in the republic of Chechnya.<p>Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr., 33, a former ally of slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, is unconscious after undergoing treatment for kidney failure.

A majority of the new dollars would come from increasing the sales tax to 6.65 percent from 6.15 percent and the cigarette tax by 50 cents a pack, to $1.29 from 79 cents. The governor previously proposed increasing tobacco and alcohol taxes and said he was open to increasing the sales tax.<p>Disagreements among Republicans on tax issues have made the GOP-dominated Legislature's annual session one of the longest in state history, at 100 days as of Saturday. The governor offered his new plan after he had said earlier in the week that he would let legislators draft their own solutions.<p>\"I thought it was time to put something out,\" Brownback said at a news conference.<p>The state's budget problems arose after the GOP-dominated Legislature slashed personal income taxes in 2012 and 2013 at Brownback's urging as an economic stimulus. Republican lawmakers are considering increases in business, sales, cigarette and even gasoline taxes but remain sharply divided.<p>House Republicans planned to review the governor's plan Saturday afternoon, and their leaders held open the possibility of a debate on tax issues later in the day. The Senate planned to debate tax issues Sunday.</div><div><p>Brownback's new proposal to end income taxes for some individuals earning up to $17,250 a year and couples earning up to $24,500 is an idea legislators haven't considered. It would save those taxpayers $19 million during the next fiscal year - an average of about $49 a year.<p>Lawmakers have debated backtracking on a 2012 policy that allowed 281,000 business owners and 53,000 farmers to avoid income taxes on their profits. Brownback's proposal would be a small move in that direction but less than legislators had considered.<p>A proposal before the House would raise $101 million during the next fiscal year by re-taxing business profits, and a plan the Senate rejected would have raised $82 million. Brownback's business tax plan would raise just $24 million.<p>Kansas cut personal income tax rates in 2012 and 2013, and the exemption for business owners and farmers is expected to save them up to $220 million during the next fiscal year if lawmakers preserve it.<p>Critics argue the exemption is unfair because business owners escape income taxes while employees' wages remain taxed.<p>Democratic Sen. Tom Holland, of Baldwin City, immediately dismissed the governor's business-tax proposal as a \"fig leaf.\" Republican Rep. Mark Hutton of Wichita said Brownback's proposal is structured so that businesses easily could use accounting maneuvers to still avoid taxes.<p>\"That's a bogus deal,\" he said.<p>But officials with the Kansas Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business said Saturday that their groups would find the governor's proposal acceptable after they lobbied hard to preserve it.<p>\"This is better than most of the plans we're seeing out there,\" chamber President and CEO Mike O'Neal said.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"Kansas governor outlines new tax plan to close budget gap","category":"economy"},"2":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/2.jpeg","summary":"The campaign of Sen.

And there was Ricky Jean Francois, cut by the Indianapolis Colts in February and scooped up by general manager Scot McCloughan four days later.<p>Together, the trio represents a new era for the Washington Redskins' defensive line, a group that has annually underperformed over the past several years. Oft-injured defensive end Stephen Bowen and veteran nose tackle Barry Cofield are out, released in a series of cost-cutting moves several months ago. Francois, Knighton and Paea are in.

But we're in a more attack-style defense now, and I think it's going to benefit us well.\"<p>Hindered in part by injuries, the Redskins' defensive line struggled to generate a pass rush for most of the 2014 season. Together, the group had just 10 1/2 sacks in 16 games, three fewer than outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan recorded himself. The line also collectively failed in the turnover department, forcing no fumbles and recovering only one. Baker led the group with 25 tackles.</div><div><hr /><p><strong> SEE ALSO: SNYDER: Robert Griffin III undoubtedly has talent; now it's time for him to realize it </strong><hr /><p>On Tuesday, returning linemen pointed to schematic differences that will allow them to get upfield more frequently and pursue opposing ballcarriers. Coach Jay Gruden said the goal is to \"get the handcuffs off of them a little bit.\"<p>\"Not that they had [handcuffs] on last year, but the frame of mind is to be a more aggressive-style defense and let them play,\" Gruden said. \"Corners are going to have some opportunities to make some plays on balls, and obviously, safeties will be very important in the run fits and all that good stuff, so I think overall, from a unit, I think defensively, the new players that we added, the new scheme we have, it's a welcomed change.\"<p>The Redskins have tried to bolster their defensive line before. In 2009, they infamously signed marquee free agent Albert Haynesworth to a gargantuan contract. Two years later, they traded him to the New England Patriots, gave Bowen and Cofield multi-year deals and drafted Jarvis Jenkins in the second round.<p>Injuries prevented Bowen and Cofield from meeting expectations, and each only participated in eight games in 2014. Their absence pushed unproven players like Frank Kearse and Clifton Geathers, now with the Pittsburgh Steelers, into significant playing time, and allowed opposing offensive lines to focus on players like Hatcher.<p>If the new defensive line additions stay healthy, that should change this year.<br />\"It helps a lot,\" Hatcher said. \"You've got guys that can take some pressure off you [so] that you're not the only person they can key on. You've got Stephen Paea, you've got Pot Roast, you've got Bake.

Gruden praised Knighton's quick first step and presence as a leader in the locker room. Baker lauded Paea's work ethic, a tendency to stay after workouts to continue lifting or running. The collective message was clear: the defensive line will be better in 2015.<p>Knighton, however, offered a reminder that the group is not there yet. Chemistry is essential up front, and still needs to be built. There is plenty of room for growth. That the defensive line seems improved in late May means nothing to him.<p>\"Names don't win you anything.

The legislative session is scheduled to end Sunday.<p>Another initiative, touted as a \"clean jobs\" measure because it would provide incentives for developing alternative power sources, such as solar- and wind-generated electricity, met the same fate. Democratic sponsor Rep. Elaine Nekritz said negotiations will continue and the proposal might need to be adjusted when President Barack Obama's climate-change initiative rules are finalized this summer.<p>\"We haven't had any comprehensive energy legislation in a long time,\" Nekritz said, \"and I think we need to be thinking about what we want our energy mix to look like in the next 10 or 15 years and that is the discussion we'll be having.\"<p>The attention to energy efforts drew the interest of southern Illinois lawmakers, who sought input late this spring and suggested that a plan to make it easier for coal-burning plants to get pollution controls necessary to burn Illinois-sourced coal, which is more damaging to the atmosphere because of its high sulfur content.<p>Nuclear energy has taken a hit in recent years as new technology has made natural gas easier, and cheaper, to obtain.</div><div><p>Under legislation backed by Exelon and sponsored by Rep.

And a sale of the Clinton plant's capacity to distributors this spring yielded a much higher price than expected, prompting a company pledge to keep the central Illinois facility open through June 2016.<p>The Nekritz plan, which has a Senate counterpart sponsored by Democrat Don Harmon of Oak Park, aims to reduce electricity demand 20 percent by 2025 and increase the amount of renewable energy produced.

John Bradley, D-Marion, led the southern Illinois contingent that's promoting a change in rules to prevent power companies from shifting the cost of importing Western coal - which has lower sulfur content than Illinois coal - onto to ratepayers. That would make Illinois coal cheaper, but many generators would need pricey equipment to keep dangerous emissions from getting into the air.<p>\"If we can move away from that, which was established many years ago under a different set of circumstances,\" Manar said, \"we can employ coal miners here in Illinois, not in places like Wyoming, and be competitive and address environmental issues all at the same time.\"<p>___<p>The bills are HB32393 and HB2607.<p>Online: http://www.ilga.gov<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"'Clean energy' bills take back seat to Illinois budget","category":"technology"},"24":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/24.jpeg","summary":"Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul said Saturday that he would make sure Patriot Act surveillance authorities lapse.

And the only anger Williams displayed was directed at her opponent, Victoria Azarenka, while they traded gestures and words over the chair umpire's decision to replay a key point.<p>By the end, when she was aggressively grabbing the final six games and 10 of the final 12, all that really mattered was that the No. 1-ranked Williams was not going to let this one get away. Williams erased deficit after deficit and beat former No. 1 Azarenka 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 Saturday in a third-round French Open match filled with momentum swings and one GIF-ready contentious exchange.<p>\"I was just really down and out in that match, and I just feel like, you know, I just really zeroed in,\" Williams said. \"I really focused and I really wanted to win that.\"<p>Williams is 28-1 in 2015, 9-0 in three-setters. The American improved to 50-11 at Roland Garros, making her the first woman since 1968, when Grand Slam tournaments admitted professionals, to have that many wins at each major.<p>She's never been as comfortable or confident on the French Open's dusty red clay as with grass or hard courts underfoot, exiting in the second round last year and the first in 2012. She's been past the quarterfinals once in the past 12 years - in 2013, when she won her second French Open title.</div><div><p>Compare that to the 33-year-old's trophies elsewhere: six apiece from the Australian Open and U.S. Open, five from Wimbledon.<p>Azarenka owns a pair of Australian Open trophies. She also was twice a U.S. Open finalist, but lost each time to Williams, who has won 16 of their 19 matchups. They tend to be close as can be: This month on clay in Madrid, Williams won after Azarenka double-faulted three times while serving for the match.<p>So maybe that collapse and Saturday's, when Azarenka led by a set and 4-2 in the second, are an indication that Williams holds an edge in more than shotmaking. She produced nearly twice as many winners as Azarenka, 41 to 21.<p>\"She really stepped it up,\" the 27th-seeded Azarenka said. \"Nobody is probably harder … for me to play against.\"<p>On the last point of the second set, Azarenka hit a shot that landed near the baseline. Williams netted a response at about the same time an \"out\" call came. Chair umpire Kader Nouni decided the point should be replayed, which Azarenka disputed. She and Williams wound up looking at each other, and Azarenka waved her hand, as if to say, \"Eh, never mind.\" Williams then appeared to tell Azarenka not to wag her hand.<p>Azarenka, who still was steamed about Nouni's ruling after the match, lost the replayed point, giving Williams the set, and was warned for a visible obscenity.<p>Azarenka headed to a bathroom break. When she returned, she took a 2-0 lead in the third set.<p>Williams wouldn't drop another game.<p>The two are friends away from the court, and both downplayed whatever testiness there seemed to be between them Saturday.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"No. 1 Williams edges Azarenka in French Open's 3rd round","category":"sport"},"121":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/121.jpg","summary":"An Anheuser-Busch plant in northwest Georgia has temporarily halted its production of beer in order to supply thousands of cans of drinking water to flood-ravaged Texas and Oklahoma.","image_name":"121.jpg","date":"2015-05-29","content":"<div><div><p>An Anheuser-Busch plant in northwest Georgia has temporarily halted its production of beer in order to supply thousands of cans of drinking water to flood-ravaged Texas and Oklahoma.<p>Anheuser-Busch said it had stopped beer production at its Cartersville brewery late Wednesday night to produce 50,000 cans of water for the American Red Cross, NBC News reported.<p>\"Right now, our production line is running emergency drinking water instead of beer,\" Cartersville brewery manager Rob Haas told NBC.<hr /><p><strong> SEE ALSO: EMS rescues 21 from houseboat in Austin </strong><hr /><p>The Cartersville brewery produces cans of emergency relief water a few times a year and partners with the American Red Cross for distribution in affected areas, Mr. Haas said.<p>\"It's something we're uniquely positioned to do in a very timely period,\" he said.<p>About 2,000 cases are en route to communities in Texas and Oklahoma, where at least 25 people have died due to storms and flooding that's damaged thousands of homes and left more than a dozen missing, NBC reported.<p>The canned drinking water is expected to arrive in affected areas within the next few days, Mr. Haas said.</div></div>","title":"Anheuser-Busch halts beer production to provide drinking water to flood-ravaged Texas, Oklahoma","category":"economy"},"79":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/79.jpg","summary":"ANALYSIS/OPINION:","image_name":"79.jpg","date":"2015-05-28","content":"<div><div><p><strong>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</strong><p>During one of the organized team activities last year, the newcomer to the Washington Redskins was asked if he was surprised at the 100 percent attendance at this particular workout.<p>\"Not really,\" he replied. \"It's hard to get everybody here, especially voluntary mini-camps and OTAs and things like that.

But if so, he has every right to do so. The confusing and frustrating part of this is that these are called \"voluntary\" workouts. The concept of these voluntary workouts puts players in difficult positions publicly, such as in cases like this. Jackson had every right to pursue this opportunity — but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.<p>They may be voluntary, but tell that to the players that did report to Redskins Park this week to take part in the first OTAs under a new general manager, new offensive line coach, new defensive coordinator and new quarterbacks coach. Nearly every Redskin player felt it was important enough to be present and begin the process of \"working together and just putting it in,\" as Jackson described OTAs last year.<p>All likely had other places they could be. For one player — even one as accomplished as Jackson — to decide his commitments were more important than theirs is not good for a franchise trying to install a \"culture change.\"<br />Yes, the dreaded words \"culture change\" reared their laughable head again this week at Redskins Park.<p>Of course, it was Robert Griffin III who uttered the most meaningless words ever spoken in that building when he talked about his relationship with Gruden.<p>\"We look forward to working together to help this team and lead this team in the right direction and create this culture change that we know we need to have,\" Griffin told reporters.<p>Culture change? Not a season seems to go by at Redskins Park where someone doesn't declare a culture change is underway, only for this team to wind up in the same dark place at the end of the season of culture change.<p>Culture change?

The new standards call for increases in blending over the next several years, but those increases fall far short of what lawmakers called for in 2007 legislation.<p>Lawmakers and other EPA critics say the latest standards reflect how the RFS, written years before U.S. oil and gas production exploded, must be scrapped or, at the very least, dramatically overhauled.<p>\"EPA's announcement adds to the building evidence of how poorly the agency has managed the renewable fuel standard, and how the mandate is in need of significant reform and oversight. Clearly, the statutory volumes are unachievable,\" Sen. Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. \"Congress wrote the RFS with the assumption that gasoline demand would continue to increase significantly due to concerns about domestic sources of energy. However, the shale boom has led to extensive growth in U.S. oil and gas production.\"<p>The EPA's latest targets are more than a year behind schedule. As a result, the agency released a 2014 standard that reflects \"the actual amount of domestic biofuel use in that year.\" The EPA also released targets for 2015 and 2016.<p>For 2014, the EPA said the total amount of renewable fuel blending was 15.93 billion gallons. It has proposed raising that figure to 16.30 billion gallons in 2015 and 17.40 billion gallons in 2016 — more than 4 billion gallons per year lower than what Congress called for in the 2007 legislation.</div><div><p>\"This proposal marks an important step forward in making sure the Renewable Fuel Standard program delivers on the congressional intent to increase biofuel use, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security,\" said Janet McCabe, the acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. \"We believe these proposed volume requirements will provide a strong incentive for continued investment and growth in biofuels.\"<p>But the EPA also admits that it is out of compliance with the levels set by Congress, largely because current fuel infrastructure and automobiles are unable to use gasoline that includes more than 10 percent ethanol. The inability to get beyond the 10-percent figure commonly is referred to as the \"blend wall\" and represents a serious hurdle for the ethanol industry.<p>\"Due to constraints in the fuel market to accommodate increasing volumes of ethanol, along with limits on the availability of non-ethanol renewable fuels, the volume targets specified by Congress in the Clean Air Act for 2014, 2015 and 2016 cannot be achieved. However, EPA recognizes that the statutory volume targets were intended to be ambitious; Congress set targets that envisioned growth at a pace that far exceeded historical growth rates,\" the EPA said in a fact sheet.<p>Opponents of the RFS say the administration must scrap the standard and acknowledge that more biofuel blending into gasoline supplies is not only unnecessary but economically dangerous.<p>\"EPA is saddled with the impossible task of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole,\" said the RFS Off the Menu coalition, a campaign focused on killing the RFS standard. \"It is time for Congress to recognize the RFS is a failed policy and either repeal it altogether or engage in a wholesale overhaul. Nothing EPA or any other agency can do will alleviate the RFS' undeniable impact on food commodity prices.\"<p>Specifically, the EPA said that in 2014 about 33 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel were blended with gasoline, along with 1.63 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel and 2.68 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.<p>For 2015, the agency is calling for those figures to increase to 106 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 1.7 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 2.9 billion gallons of advanced biofuel. In 2016, the numbers increase further, to 206 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 3.4 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 3.4 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.</div></div>","title":"Biofuels mandate mess: New EPA ethanol standards under fire","category":"economy"},"99":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/99.jpg","summary":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Brian Dozier drove in the tiebreaking run with a triple in the seventh inning, lifting the Minnesota Twins past the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 on Saturday.","image_name":"99.jpg","date":"2015-05-30","content":"<div><div><p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Brian Dozier drove in the tiebreaking run with a triple in the seventh inning, lifting the Minnesota Twins past the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 on Saturday.<p>Blaine Boyer pitched a perfect ninth for his first save, giving major league leader Glen Perkins a break after the All-Star closer gave up the go-ahead, two-run homer to Chris Colabello the night before.<p>Kyle Gibson got the Blue Jays to hit into a double play in each of the first three innings.

In 2009, they infamously signed marquee free agent Albert Haynesworth to a gargantuan contract. Two years later, they traded him to the New England Patriots, gave Bowen and Cofield multi-year deals and drafted Jarvis Jenkins in the second round.<p>Injuries prevented Bowen and Cofield from meeting expectations, and each only participated in eight games in 2014. Their absence pushed unproven players like Frank Kearse and Clifton Geathers, now with the Pittsburgh Steelers, into significant playing time, and allowed opposing offensive lines to focus on players like Hatcher.<p>If the new defensive line additions stay healthy, that should change this year.<br />\"It helps a lot,\" Hatcher said. \"You've got guys that can take some pressure off you [so] that you're not the only person they can key on.

Gruden praised Knighton's quick first step and presence as a leader in the locker room. Baker lauded Paea's work ethic, a tendency to stay after workouts to continue lifting or running. The collective message was clear: the defensive line will be better in 2015.<p>Knighton, however, offered a reminder that the group is not there yet. Chemistry is essential up front, and still needs to be built. There is plenty of room for growth. That the defensive line seems improved in late May means nothing to him.<p>\"Names don't win you anything. It's about putting the work in,\" Knighton said. \"Obviously, I was on a really good team that had numerous Pro Bowl guys, and we fell short at the end.

The new standards call for increases in blending over the next several years, but those increases fall far short of what lawmakers called for in 2007 legislation.<p>Lawmakers and other EPA critics say the latest standards reflect how the RFS, written years before U.S. oil and gas production exploded, must be scrapped or, at the very least, dramatically overhauled.<p>\"EPA's announcement adds to the building evidence of how poorly the agency has managed the renewable fuel standard, and how the mandate is in need of significant reform and oversight. Clearly, the statutory volumes are unachievable,\" Sen. Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. \"Congress wrote the RFS with the assumption that gasoline demand would continue to increase significantly due to concerns about domestic sources of energy. However, the shale boom has led to extensive growth in U.S. oil and gas production.\"<p>The EPA's latest targets are more than a year behind schedule. As a result, the agency released a 2014 standard that reflects \"the actual amount of domestic biofuel use in that year.\" The EPA also released targets for 2015 and 2016.<p>For 2014, the EPA said the total amount of renewable fuel blending was 15.93 billion gallons. It has proposed raising that figure to 16.30 billion gallons in 2015 and 17.40 billion gallons in 2016 — more than 4 billion gallons per year lower than what Congress called for in the 2007 legislation.</div><div><p>\"This proposal marks an important step forward in making sure the Renewable Fuel Standard program delivers on the congressional intent to increase biofuel use, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security,\" said Janet McCabe, the acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. \"We believe these proposed volume requirements will provide a strong incentive for continued investment and growth in biofuels.\"<p>But the EPA also admits that it is out of compliance with the levels set by Congress, largely because current fuel infrastructure and automobiles are unable to use gasoline that includes more than 10 percent ethanol. The inability to get beyond the 10-percent figure commonly is referred to as the \"blend wall\" and represents a serious hurdle for the ethanol industry.<p>\"Due to constraints in the fuel market to accommodate increasing volumes of ethanol, along with limits on the availability of non-ethanol renewable fuels, the volume targets specified by Congress in the Clean Air Act for 2014, 2015 and 2016 cannot be achieved. However, EPA recognizes that the statutory volume targets were intended to be ambitious; Congress set targets that envisioned growth at a pace that far exceeded historical growth rates,\" the EPA said in a fact sheet.<p>Opponents of the RFS say the administration must scrap the standard and acknowledge that more biofuel blending into gasoline supplies is not only unnecessary but economically dangerous.<p>\"EPA is saddled with the impossible task of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole,\" said the RFS Off the Menu coalition, a campaign focused on killing the RFS standard. \"It is time for Congress to recognize the RFS is a failed policy and either repeal it altogether or engage in a wholesale overhaul. Nothing EPA or any other agency can do will alleviate the RFS' undeniable impact on food commodity prices.\"<p>Specifically, the EPA said that in 2014 about 33 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel were blended with gasoline, along with 1.63 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel and 2.68 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.<p>For 2015, the agency is calling for those figures to increase to 106 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 1.7 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 2.9 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.

(AP) - The newly legal hemp industry is entering its second growing season with some big questions for producers experimenting with marijuana's non-intoxicating cousin.<p>The federal government has allowed limited imports of hemp seed - in Colorado's case, this month - for research and development purposes. Companies trying to create a U.S. hemp industry are seeking investors not only for unproven products but for a plant that is still classified under the federal Controlled Substances Act with marijuana and thus cannot be patented.<p>As a result, it's too soon to tell whether hemp will become a boon for farmers or stay in mostly boutique products that use imported hemp.<p>At least 22 states allow hemp cultivation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, though most are limited to experimental testing, not commercial industry. Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture say they're not sure how many states are growing hemp or how much is being produced.<p>Two hemp facilities in northern Colorado underscore the crop's uncertainty.<p>A biomass factory about an hour's drive north of Denver is processing hemp into pulp, sugars and lignin. PureVision Technology CEO Ed Lehrburger is also experimenting with hemp stalks, sensing potential for a broad array of industrial uses but unable to secure enough to see whether it could replace wheat, corn and wood as raw materials for use in things like plastics, fuels and packaging.</div><div><p>\"We don't have enough hemp to process,\" said Lehrburger, who created a subsidiary, PureHemp Technology, but concedes the hemp business is a few years from taking off. He's paying $500 a ton for the scarce commodity, compared to $65 for a ton of corn stalks.<p>But Lehrburger is bullish on hemp's industrial potential. Pointing to a room-sized machine that processes the biomass into pulp, Lehrburger explained that hemp stalks become pulp faster than other raw materials and require less water.<p>Just down the road, a greenhouse contains a more tantalizing prospect. The company CBDRx is growing several hundred hemp plants in order to extract cannabidiol - frequently shortened to CBD - a non-intoxicating part of hemp that some believe has a variety of medical applications, from alleviating pain and inflammation to managing seizures.<p>CBDRx's owners believe hemp's therapeutic potential far exceeds any other commercial use. The company, created in January, plans to expand to 200 or more employees within a year, thanks to a large investment of venture capital.<p>\"We see this as a very huge market, much bigger than the marijuana market,\" said Alejandro Bergad, CBDRx's chief agricultural officer for the company. \"We're poised for national expansion.\"<p>But CBDRx must first to develop a product they can't yet patent and make sure their plants don't contain too much of the plant's more popular chemical, THC, which produces a high.<p>The federal Controlled Substances Act makes no difference between hemp as a plant and marijuana as a drug.<p>Plants containing more than 0.3 percent THC are considered marijuana and must be destroyed by law, though licensed hemp growers aren't subject to criminal prosecution if their plants are too strong. Last year, the first in which Colorado licensed hemp growers, agriculture authorities ordered the destruction of about an acre's worth of plants after spot inspections, out of 1,811 total licensed acres.<p>More growers have signed up this year, with 2,637 acres licensed. Colorado now allows indoor hemp production, too, with 465,000 square feet in production statewide, such as the CBDRx greenhouse.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"Hemp industry enters 2nd year with hazy market potential","category":"technology"},"66":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/66.jpeg","summary":"U.S. officials said they were seriously examining an Iranian dissident group's claims on Thursday that Iran and North Korea are forging ballistic missile and nuclear research ties — but that the allegations are unlikely to derail ongoing nuclear negotiations between Western powers and Tehran.","image_name":"66.jpeg","date":"2015-05-29","content":"<div><div><p>U.S. officials said they were seriously examining an Iranian dissident group's claims on Thursday that Iran and North Korea are forging ballistic missile and nuclear research ties — but that the allegations are unlikely to derail ongoing nuclear negotiations between Western powers and Tehran.<p>\"We have seen these claims, and we take any such reports seriously,\" said State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke. \"But we don't have any information at this time that would lead us to believe that these allegations impact our ongoing negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.\"<p>He added that U.S. officials have not yet been able to verify the claims made by members of the dissident National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).<p>The dissident group, which has offices in Paris and Washington, claims to have evidence proving that a delegation of North Korean nuclear and missile experts visited a military site near Tehran in April amid the ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran, the U.S. and other world powers.<p>Analysts say the exiled NCRI has a clear political agenda to smear the government in Tehran and to try and disrupt the nuclear talks. The group has a controversial past in Washington, where the State Department for years listed a key arm of it known as the Mujahedin-e-Khalq, or \"MEK,\" as a terrorist organization.<p>But the dissident group also has a history of exposing major clandestine nuclear operations in Iran.

Iran and the so-called \"P5+1\" group are presently scrambling to meet a self-imposed June 30 deadline to reach a comprehensive deal that would restrict Iran's nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions on the Islamic Republic.<p>A core issue involves the question of how the U.S. and its allies can implement reliable monitoring and verification measures to ensure Iran is not clandestinely pursuing nuclear weapons.<p>Citing information from sources inside Iran, including within Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, the NCRI claimed Thursday that a seven-person North Korean Defense Ministry team visited Iran during the last week of April.<p>The group said the visit was the third made by the North Koreans during 2015 and a nine-person delegation was due to return to Tehran in June.<p>\"The delegates included nuclear experts, nuclear warhead experts and experts in various elements of ballistic missiles including guidance systems,\" the NCRI said.<p>The Iranian embassy in France dismissed the claim.<p>In Washington, Mr. Rathke declined to comment on whether U.S. officials intend to raise the NCRI's allegations during nuclear talks with Iran.<p>\"We're looking at them seriously,\" he said. \"We're examining them.

The new standards call for increases in blending over the next several years, but those increases fall far short of what lawmakers called for in 2007 legislation.<p>Lawmakers and other EPA critics say the latest standards reflect how the RFS, written years before U.S. oil and gas production exploded, must be scrapped or, at the very least, dramatically overhauled.<p>\"EPA's announcement adds to the building evidence of how poorly the agency has managed the renewable fuel standard, and how the mandate is in need of significant reform and oversight. Clearly, the statutory volumes are unachievable,\" Sen. Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. \"Congress wrote the RFS with the assumption that gasoline demand would continue to increase significantly due to concerns about domestic sources of energy. However, the shale boom has led to extensive growth in U.S. oil and gas production.\"<p>The EPA's latest targets are more than a year behind schedule. As a result, the agency released a 2014 standard that reflects \"the actual amount of domestic biofuel use in that year.\" The EPA also released targets for 2015 and 2016.<p>For 2014, the EPA said the total amount of renewable fuel blending was 15.93 billion gallons. It has proposed raising that figure to 16.30 billion gallons in 2015 and 17.40 billion gallons in 2016 — more than 4 billion gallons per year lower than what Congress called for in the 2007 legislation.</div><div><p>\"This proposal marks an important step forward in making sure the Renewable Fuel Standard program delivers on the congressional intent to increase biofuel use, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security,\" said Janet McCabe, the acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. \"We believe these proposed volume requirements will provide a strong incentive for continued investment and growth in biofuels.\"<p>But the EPA also admits that it is out of compliance with the levels set by Congress, largely because current fuel infrastructure and automobiles are unable to use gasoline that includes more than 10 percent ethanol. The inability to get beyond the 10-percent figure commonly is referred to as the \"blend wall\" and represents a serious hurdle for the ethanol industry.<p>\"Due to constraints in the fuel market to accommodate increasing volumes of ethanol, along with limits on the availability of non-ethanol renewable fuels, the volume targets specified by Congress in the Clean Air Act for 2014, 2015 and 2016 cannot be achieved. However, EPA recognizes that the statutory volume targets were intended to be ambitious; Congress set targets that envisioned growth at a pace that far exceeded historical growth rates,\" the EPA said in a fact sheet.<p>Opponents of the RFS say the administration must scrap the standard and acknowledge that more biofuel blending into gasoline supplies is not only unnecessary but economically dangerous.<p>\"EPA is saddled with the impossible task of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole,\" said the RFS Off the Menu coalition, a campaign focused on killing the RFS standard. \"It is time for Congress to recognize the RFS is a failed policy and either repeal it altogether or engage in a wholesale overhaul. Nothing EPA or any other agency can do will alleviate the RFS' undeniable impact on food commodity prices.\"<p>Specifically, the EPA said that in 2014 about 33 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel were blended with gasoline, along with 1.63 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel and 2.68 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.<p>For 2015, the agency is calling for those figures to increase to 106 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 1.7 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 2.9 billion gallons of advanced biofuel. In 2016, the numbers increase further, to 206 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 3.4 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 3.4 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.</div></div>","title":"Biofuels mandate mess: New EPA ethanol standards under fire","category":"politics"},"54":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/54.jpeg","summary":"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will not participate in the Iowa straw poll, his campaign team confirmed Saturday. ","image_name":"54.jpeg","date":"2015-05-30","content":"<div><div><p>Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will not participate in the Iowa straw poll, his campaign team confirmed Saturday. <p>The Florida senator is the latest to join a slew of potential 2016 GOP nominees who have said they will not participate in the poll, long considered a staple on the road to the presidential nomination, Politico reported.<p>Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, South Carolina Sen.

The U.S. trade gap — the difference between the value of exports and the larger value of imports — was found to be wider than first estimated. And consumer spending was slower than previously thought.<p>But steady job gains are expected to fuel modestly healthy growth for the rest of 2015. The harsh winter, which kept many consumers home and businesses closed, and a labor dispute that slowed trade at West Coast ports are both over. Home sales and construction are rebounding, along with business investment.<p>Analysts generally foresee the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, growing at an annual rate of 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the April-June quarter, with further strengthening later in the year. But risks remain: A stronger dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, will likely continue to keep the trade deficit wide. And cutbacks in oil drilling, a result of low energy prices, could depress spending in the energy industry.<p>\"While the evidence of a second-quarter rebound hasn't been overwhelming, we still think that the outlook for the economy is very encouraging,\" Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.<p>Last quarter's contraction marked the first since a 2.1 percent annual drop in the first three months of 2014, a slump that was also due in part to severe winter weather.</div><div><p>Last quarter, the trade gap subtracted 1.9 percentage points from growth, the biggest drag in 30 years. Consumer spending, which drives about 70 percent of economic activity, slowed to annual growth of just 1.8 percent for the quarter, slightly below the government's first estimate. Consumers spent less on mobile phone services, among other expenses, than initially thought.<p>One of the biggest hits to the economy last quarter came from cuts in drilling activity by energy companies — fallout from the sharp drop in oil prices over the past year. The government said investment in the category that covers energy exploration plunged at an annual rate of 48.6 percent, the steepest drop since 2009, during the Great Recession.<p>The government also downgraded its estimate of the boost the economy got from business restocking. That change should be a positive for second quarter growth, because it means businesses won't have as large a backlog of unsold goods.<p>Not all the revisions to the initial estimate for the first quarter were lower. Housing construction and business investment in equipment were both revised higher.<p>Though falling GDP can be a sign of a recession, economists see little cause for such concern this year.<p>Many economists also suspect that the government's calculations have tended to underestimate growth in the first quarter of each year. GDP has contracted in three quarters since the recession ended six years ago, and all three declines came in the first quarter of the year.<p>The outlook has brightened considerably since winter. Most economists expect lower gas prices will eventually accelerate consumer spending, the main fuel for the economy.<p>So far, most consumers haven't used their gasoline savings to spend much more on other goods and services. The average U.S. pump price reached $2.03 a gallon in January, the lowest level in eight years. Though the average has risen back to $2.74, according to AAA, that's still nearly a dollar below its point a year ago.<p>Analysts also say that steadily solid hiring, which has helped cut the unemployment rate to a seven-year low of 5.4 percent, will continue to put money in more people's hands and fuel spending gains.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"U.S. economy shrank in winter but staging a spring rebound","category":"economy"},"40":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/40.jpg","summary":"The Pentagon will attempt to create a device that can essentially make the unseen suddenly seen — in three dimensions.","image_name":"40.jpg","date":"2015-05-29","content":"<div><div><p>The Pentagon will attempt to create a device that can essentially make the unseen suddenly seen — in three dimensions.<p>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has started a project aimed at capturing information carried by light waves that traditional cameras can't detect, which would allow troops to create a 3-D image of what can't be seen from a single vantage point.<p>\"DARPA's Revolutionary Enhancement of Visibility by Exploiting Active Light-fields (REVEAL) program seeks to unlock information in photons that current imaging systems discard.

An MRI supported the worst-case conjecture. Hall had torn his left Achilles' tendon. For the first time in his 12-year career, Hall's time on the field lasted less than three games because of a season-ending surgery.<p>Hall, 31, estimates he began playing football consistently when he was 11 or 12 years old. Because of the injury, he has not motored around a field or trash-talked a receiver in the eight months since the tendon tear. Instead, he has been working toward a return projected to begin at training camp in August.<br />He tore the same tendon a second time when he slipped not long after his first surgery. He had to wait several weeks for his tendon to heal enough that he could again put weight on his left leg. He's been locked into the tedium of rehabilitation exercises since.<p>Hall has evolved from non-weight-bearing to noisy sideline observer during organized team activities. He shouted on the sideline Tuesday at Redskins Park, while watching his teammates take a sweat-filled beating from a merciless sun and an increased practice tempo.

Physically, I feel like I can do everything now. Just precautionary.\"<p>Tuesday, he did light individual footwork drills. His cleats came off, and he went to observe seven-on-seven drills. He later hooked up with the training staff to do some more light running.<p>\"Just trying to get in shape,\" Hall said.</div><div><p>His age, as so often is the case, is a benefit and reason for questions. He's played for three NFL teams — including seven seasons in Washington. His three trips to the Pro Bowl highlighted his skill at cornerback, but he hasn't been selected for the team in five years. Being in the league since 2004 allows Hall to type \"seen it all\" on his resume, though the necessary experience to reach that status also clouds his future a bit on a team with multiple cornerback options.<p>The Redskins did receive some clarity at cornerback Wednesday when they cut oft-injured Tracy Porter. Coach Jay Gruden mentioned Tuesday that he was impressed with Hall's accelerated recovery. Cutting Porter appears to be a nod toward the confidence the Redskins have that Hall can return and be effective.<p>\"He's coming along very fast from the Achilles surgery,\" Gruden said. \"I knew he would be. He's at a stage of his career where he knows how important preparation is, both on and off the field. Physically, he's got to get himself ready to go after that injury, and it's going to take some time, but he has shown major, major improvements already.\"<p>Gruden initially explained that Hall's second Achilles tear occurred when he slipped in the kitchen fetching late-night pizza. Hall reiterated Tuesday he \"slipped,\" then fell, causing a second tear. He said re-injuring the same spot in a way more associated with comedy duo hijinks than an elite professional athlete was not off-putting.<p>\"Really no reaction,\" Hall said. \"I was a couple weeks behind. It wasn't a huge setback. It wasn't like I was eight, nine weeks out and had to go from Phase 1. I was pretty much a couple weeks out [from the first surgery]. Still non-weight-bearing, hadn't done anything. So, if I was going to tear it again, that was a good time to tear it, they said.\"<p>He laughed when it was suggested that there may not be a good time to tear an Achilles' tendon.<p>After his mishap, Hall said he knew something was wrong. Like that day in Philadelphia, Hall's level of pain suggested another high-end problem which was again confirmed by the loud pops and whirs of an MRI machine.<p>The injury put Hall into a winter and spring of rehabilitation. Meanwhile, the Redskins' young cornerback tandem of David Amerson and Bashaud Breeland worked on all-around improvements. Each has grappled with the wobbling starts most young players go through when adapting to the professional level. Breeland appeared to figure out the speed of the game as his rookie season went along, providing thumping tackles and bravado. However, the anticipated catapult for Amerson to move from promising rookie to stable second-year player last season did not happen. He struggled.<p>The Redskins also gave former San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver a lavish four-year, $32 million deal in the offseason. Culliver received $5 million just for signing his name. Combined with Amerson and Breeland, Culliver's arrival puts Hall in a new position during training camp. His role may be reduced, since the Redskins have restructured their cornerback depth following Hall's ominous reach for his leg in Week 3 of last season.<p><em>Story Continues →</em></div></div>","title":"DeAngelo Hall making strides in recovery from surgery on left Achilles tendon","category":"sport"},"59":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/59.jpg","summary":"Former Maryland Gov.

The new standards call for increases in blending over the next several years, but those increases fall far short of what lawmakers called for in 2007 legislation.<p>Lawmakers and other EPA critics say the latest standards reflect how the RFS, written years before U.S. oil and gas production exploded, must be scrapped or, at the very least, dramatically overhauled.<p>\"EPA's announcement adds to the building evidence of how poorly the agency has managed the renewable fuel standard, and how the mandate is in need of significant reform and oversight. Clearly, the statutory volumes are unachievable,\" Sen. Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. \"Congress wrote the RFS with the assumption that gasoline demand would continue to increase significantly due to concerns about domestic sources of energy. However, the shale boom has led to extensive growth in U.S. oil and gas production.\"<p>The EPA's latest targets are more than a year behind schedule. As a result, the agency released a 2014 standard that reflects \"the actual amount of domestic biofuel use in that year.\" The EPA also released targets for 2015 and 2016.<p>For 2014, the EPA said the total amount of renewable fuel blending was 15.93 billion gallons. It has proposed raising that figure to 16.30 billion gallons in 2015 and 17.40 billion gallons in 2016 — more than 4 billion gallons per year lower than what Congress called for in the 2007 legislation.</div><div><p>\"This proposal marks an important step forward in making sure the Renewable Fuel Standard program delivers on the congressional intent to increase biofuel use, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security,\" said Janet McCabe, the acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. \"We believe these proposed volume requirements will provide a strong incentive for continued investment and growth in biofuels.\"<p>But the EPA also admits that it is out of compliance with the levels set by Congress, largely because current fuel infrastructure and automobiles are unable to use gasoline that includes more than 10 percent ethanol. The inability to get beyond the 10-percent figure commonly is referred to as the \"blend wall\" and represents a serious hurdle for the ethanol industry.<p>\"Due to constraints in the fuel market to accommodate increasing volumes of ethanol, along with limits on the availability of non-ethanol renewable fuels, the volume targets specified by Congress in the Clean Air Act for 2014, 2015 and 2016 cannot be achieved. However, EPA recognizes that the statutory volume targets were intended to be ambitious; Congress set targets that envisioned growth at a pace that far exceeded historical growth rates,\" the EPA said in a fact sheet.<p>Opponents of the RFS say the administration must scrap the standard and acknowledge that more biofuel blending into gasoline supplies is not only unnecessary but economically dangerous.<p>\"EPA is saddled with the impossible task of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole,\" said the RFS Off the Menu coalition, a campaign focused on killing the RFS standard. \"It is time for Congress to recognize the RFS is a failed policy and either repeal it altogether or engage in a wholesale overhaul. Nothing EPA or any other agency can do will alleviate the RFS' undeniable impact on food commodity prices.\"<p>Specifically, the EPA said that in 2014 about 33 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel were blended with gasoline, along with 1.63 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel and 2.68 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.<p>For 2015, the agency is calling for those figures to increase to 106 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 1.7 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 2.9 billion gallons of advanced biofuel. In 2016, the numbers increase further, to 206 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel; 3.4 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel; and 3.4 billion gallons of advanced biofuel.</div></div>","title":"Biofuels mandate mess: New EPA ethanol standards under fire","category":"politics"},"111":{"image_path":"D:/top-news-articles/images/111.jpeg","summary":"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will not participate in the Iowa straw poll, his campaign team confirmed Saturday. ","image_name":"111.jpeg","date":"2015-05-30","content":"<div><div><p>Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will not participate in the Iowa straw poll, his campaign team confirmed Saturday. <p>The Florida senator is the latest to join a slew of potential 2016 GOP nominees who have said they will not participate in the poll, long considered a staple on the road to the presidential nomination, Politico reported.<p>Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, South Carolina Sen.
